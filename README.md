## FAQs
***
A list of frequently asked questions
1. **Is it legal to download a playlist with Nightingale**
Honestly, I have no idea. But, none of technologies I used was forbidden and I didn't mean to make something illegal. 
2. **Why didn't You used API**
I could, I wanted it to be a challange. 
3. **Why is it slow?**
Nightingale is not slow, I tried to write most optimized code. But downloading and information gathering part could proccess slowly in your computer, that is because your internet connection. 
4. **Why does it stop downloading suddenly?**
Again, I have no idea. It is probably because of [youtube_dl](https://youtube-dl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), If it stops for a while you can make it continue with ctrl+c hotkey.
